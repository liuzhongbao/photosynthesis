<h2 align="center">Photosynthesis</h2>

   Photosynthesis is a set of complete scaffolding system that supports multi-terminal (PC / mobile) and combines with the latest version of webback4. The whole process of project 1.0 from directory structure to webback configuration is completed by the author alone. Open source this project is also the hope that people with the same aspirations can come together to maintain this ecosystem, let's build a prosperous circle!

#### Self perception

The writing process of the architecture is very lonely. You can't see the results for a long time, and you won't necessarily solve the needs of others. With the determination to affirm yourself, I started to build the architecture. Thank you for coming all the way to support my friend @ zuihang. This is my best teacher in aribaba. He always let me escape from the comfort zone and make me progress, @ Dafan, my Girl friend.  it's because of you that I will constantly improve myself. Human nature is originally greedy, but how to use it reasonably and graft it on other affairs may become carnival, which is not a matter of course, just like I cherish now.

## What's the difference with tradition?

| 完整性 | 性能 | 文档完善度 |

#### photosynthesis 
| 完整性 | 性能 | 文档完善度 |

| 60%     |   80%     |    20%    |   

It can be seen from the comparison that the first two photosynthesizations are successful. Because the author's architecture is still in its infancy, more partners are needed to improve it, especially in document development. Because the author has been developing react for a long time, the first stage of the project is mainly react.Most of them can look forward to the follow-up progress.

## What are the advantages of photosynthesis?

1. In terms of construction speed, photosynthesis has significantly improved by using multi process packaging, multi page packaging, SSR, dynamic import, and support for multi-terminal, currently PC / mobile. At the same time, based on the ideal of microkernel, it reduces the amount of code and is simple and easy to use while writing the bottom layer with the characteristics of scalability and reusability.

2. The design of the project directory is built by referring to the project design in our work, which is simple and clear, and convenient for team cooperation.
